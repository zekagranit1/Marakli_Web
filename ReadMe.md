to start the project and have the best result please put the project inside htdocs in xampp folder with folder name
marakli_web so everything works correctly 

the main page starts at the file named index inside general components folder 
the specific path of this folder is ./marakli_web/components/general components/index.php

you can browse the web page from there normaly 

everything is organised as if it was a normal web page 

most of back end logic can be found in controllers folder

database folder consist of database constructor  (intializer ) and database sql file named marakli_web.sql 
wich you can import in php my admin so everyhthing works as it should.

going to profile or other pages that you dont have acces without loging in may cause errors(through link)

Enjoy!!!
